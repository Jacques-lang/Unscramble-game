This program is a word scramble game built using `tkinter` in Python. Here is a step-by-step description of its functionality:

1. **Imports and Global Variables**:
   - Imports necessary modules (`random`, `tkinter`, `PIL` for image handling, and `difficultyList` for word lists).
   - Defines global variables for the chosen word, shuffled word, score, counter, and color.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `get_shuffled_word()`: Selects a random word from the `easiest_words` list in `difficultyList`, shuffles its characters, and updates the global variables `chosen_word` and `shuffled_word`.
   - `shuffling()`: Handles the logic for verifying the user's guess, updating the score, and managing the game state. It checks the user's input against the chosen word, updates the score and color based on the result, and disables the verify button after 5 attempts.

3. **GUI Setup**:
   - Initializes the main `tkinter` window.
   - Loads and displays an image.
   - Creates and positions various widgets (labels, entry field, button) for displaying the scrambled word, user input, score, and game messages.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The user is prompted to unscramble a word.
   - The user enters their guess in a text field and clicks the "Verify word" button.
   - The program checks the guess, updates the score and feedback message, and reshuffles the word for the next attempt.
   - After 5 attempts, the game ends, and the button is disabled with a final message displayed.

The game uses a simple scoring system and provides feedback based on the user's performance.
